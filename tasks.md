## Ideas or Tasks

### Task 1: LLM Models: Nathan & Saul

- Work with creating assistants, threads, and managing scalability.

- Test what happens when two users send a message at the same time

- [Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview)

### Task 2: Mongo DB Functions: Nathan & Katie

- When a user signs up, create a new assistant id for each model we currently have.

### Task 3: Setting Form (Katie)

- Once a user signs up, present a form that allows them to insert information like availability, interest, and etc.

- Send the information to the back-end to be inserted into the database.

### Task 4: Role-based Access Control

- Assigning users to different roles to have different permissions.

- Give permissions based on admin, student, or teacher to create custom Assistants

- Give permissions based on who can access the custom assistant created

  - Maybe the user wants to select which users can have access to this assistant.
