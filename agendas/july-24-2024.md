## Meeting Notes

- For those interested in publication, we will be looking into if any of them are a good match for us
    - Another possibility is to do a medium article, which is more like a tutorial on how to do something. Counts less as a academic article but can still be pointed to. List the problem, describe the tools, how we used them, difficulties, and advice. Includes code snippets and diagrams. 

- We will need some form of poster at the end of this

- Goal at the end of this is some form of program at least Comp Sci students can use

- Continue thinking about Agentic design

- Nathan and Yatharth can talk about an outline of a publication and human subject proposal while Saul and Yatharth can talk about RAG
