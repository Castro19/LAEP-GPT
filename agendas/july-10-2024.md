## Meeting Notes

- MongoDB is also being worked with
- We are limited with GPU's in Microsoft Azure
- Q&A:
    - Look into seeing created user accounts in Mongo/Firebase and how to manage those (Talk to Christian)
- Agentic Design:
    - Instead of using a singe LLM, using a team of LLM's. Used to be known as multi agent systems, but collaboration was tedious and cumbersome. With the development of LLM's, you can tell them to work together without defining API's or protocals.
    - Look into using Agentic design for this project, but don't let it become a distraction. How to split up the tasks? Heres suggestions:
        - One for ethical and one for social aspects, one for web scraping, one for factualty representation and one for student representation, one coordinator
        - Different loads, where one agent has very strong ethical operands and one that is more fast and loose that just wants results and they argue about benefits and drawbacks, or different stakeholders
- Articles on Agentic Design and other resources are shared on the slack
