## 3. Progress

    - Optional anonymity in survey responses
    - Data will be collected through web forms (google or microsoft forms), data will be retained in Prof. Kurfess's OneDrive account for a minimum of one year with a chance of more if project continues
    
Web scraping is a work in progress
    - Next steps are to work on adding it to the database so the Ai can use it

- OpenAI has the same data privacy as Microsoft Azure as long as you don't opt into it, and data is confidential unless there is a legal matter
    - We have decided to continue with OpenAI until costs become a concern
